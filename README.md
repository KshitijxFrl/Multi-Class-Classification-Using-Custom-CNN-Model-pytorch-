# Multi-Class-Classification-Using-Custom-CNN-Model-pytorch-
This is a multi class classification project which is using a custom cnn model for the classification.This project is using pytorch machine learning frame work for the it CNN part along with some other python library.The classification has been done on the data set which is having four different classes.This perticular model is capabel to handle dataset of any size with any number of classes (***This version of the model is not dealing with the problem of some classes having less data when compare to the rest of the classes***).
# DATA SET
The dataset used for this project is a custom data set (***Feel free to download and use it***) with four different classes (ABCD -> Aeroplane, Bus, Cat, Dog).The entire dataset is having two compoents first one is dataset (on this data set is trained) and second one is testdata (on this data set is tested).
